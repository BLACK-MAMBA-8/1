            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>When coding, we can probably tweak the pseudocode to cut down on steps and runs, like predicting the maze layout beforehand. So, the code needs constant upgrades to be as lean and user-friendly as possible, while keeping it solid to avoid any hiccups in different scenarios. In addition, it would be better if we could find a code that can handle different mazes, maybe we will learn this in the future.
